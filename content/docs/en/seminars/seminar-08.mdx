# Seminar 8 - Code Review Workshop

## Lecture Topics

### Peer Review Techniques

1. **Preparation**
    - Read code before meeting
    - Prepare questions

2. **During review**
    - Focus on code, not on the person
    - Ask questions instead of criticizing
    - Suggest solutions

3. **Principle: "Focus on code, not person"**
    - "This code could be more readable" ✓
    - "You write unreadable code" ✗

### Examples of Constructive Feedback

| Bad                            | Good                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| "This is bad"                  | "What if we tried it like this?"      |
| "You don't understand OOP"     | "This design pattern could help here" |
| "Why did you do it like this?" | "Can you explain this approach?"      |
